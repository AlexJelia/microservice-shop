Application designed through microservice architecture <br>
The main goal of the project is to build and dockerize a microservice architecture application <br>
This design approaches in which a single application is built as a set of small services.<br>
Each module runs in its own process and interacts with other modules.<br>
Modules work independently and are built around business needs and perform a specific function.<br>
